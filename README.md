# Virtual Tourist
4th app for the Udacity iOS Nanodegree.  Tests a combination of skills in UIKit, RESTful web APIs, and Core Data.

Virtual Tourist allows you to easily explore the world around you by selecting a spot on a map and grabbing public images of that place from Flickr.  Virtual Tourist saves all of these places for you and their photos.  They won't just disappear.  The app allows you to refresh the photos of any place and allow you to selectively delete photos or map pins so that you can curate your collection.
